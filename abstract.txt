As the amount of labelled content on the web is on an ever increase, textual analysis tasks like topic modelling are of utmost importance. Although R has many packages like 'tm' and 'stylo' for the same purpose but all of them are unsupervised topic models. Also, there isn't any single package which would take care of the complete workflow of text mining and analysis starting from pre-processing of data till the very end of visualizing topic models of a document. Thus, proposed is a new package in R which would firstly, take care of the complete workflow of topic modelling of a document by integrating functionalities from these packages. Secondly, we also aim to implement a supervised topic model for multi labelled corpora of text which is known as Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation. It is an extension of the famous LDA algorithm to fit a supervised learning setting.
